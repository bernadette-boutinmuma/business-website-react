        Canada, and of the Global joint review process, with emphasis on product chemistry.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked as a pesticide residue chemist before joining Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA).
        I evaluated chemistry data for all types of submissions for over 15 years as a senior scientific evaluator, and
        for two years I led the chemistry unit and the Formulants section, as a section head.

        I have helped companies prepare product chemistry packages to regulatory agencies to fulfill government
